# CS4248 Team29: Labeled Unreliable News
## Abstract
Today, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is highly capable of automating content creation, thereby driving the widespread proliferation of indistinguishable fake news at a rate that overwhelms fact-checkers. This study developed a system to predict whether a news article or statement, specifically political ones, should be classified as trusted or misinformation. The system employs a logistic regression model to predict directly extractable features and derived features from a DistilBERT model. Detailed analysis was conducted to comprehend the impact each feature has on the model's prediction.
